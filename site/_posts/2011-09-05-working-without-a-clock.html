		It's that time of year again. That time, late in the year, where I start wishing I blogged more often. It actually started earlier this year
		when I rewrote this whole blog<sup><a href="#super" name="ident_1">1</a></sup> back in March. So what got me back here in a text editor writing
		a blog post? Really it came down to that weekly feeling at the end of the weekend that I've finished very little. I guess if I can finish at 
		least one small blog post, I can start feeling like I've finished something.

		Last night, I stumbled upon a <a href="http://blog.zachwaugh.com/post/6290996753/working-without-a-clock"> post about working without a clock
		by developer Zach Waugh.</a> It got me thinking a lot about how I spend the whole weekend looking at the clock, fretting about how little
		time I have left before the week begins. The idea is to remove the clock from your mind and just work. You may work late or have to take a 
		really late lunch, but removing this one more thing from your mind frees you up. This isn't new either, this famous quote leads to the same 
		conclusion:
	</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>"I owe my success to the fact I never had a clock in my workroom"</p><span class="person">– Thomas Edison</span>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>
		I'll be trying this now. Most days, I don't need to know the time. I rarely have meetings. Mornings at work become a countdown to lunchtime.
		My laptops now have no time displaying, and I'll be making this change on my work machine as well. I guess if it helps me get more done by focusing
		on the work and not the clock, my posts will be more frequent than once a year.
