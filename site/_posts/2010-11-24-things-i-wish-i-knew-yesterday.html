title: Things I wish I knew yesterday
preview: Even when you’ve been working in an environment for years, you still find things you never knew. I liken it to learning about a famous actor you had never heard of, but has starred in all your favorite movies.

		Even when you’ve been working in an environment for years, you still find things you never knew. I liken it to learning about a famous actor you had never heard of, but has starred in all your favorite movies.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I found two things that I wish I had known or seen, but for whatever reason, I missed.
	</p>
	
	<p>	
		First up, convenience functions for converting a CGRect to a NSString or a NSString to a CGRect.
	</p>
	
	{% highlight objectivec %}
		CGRectFromString(NSString *string)
		NSStringFromCGRect(CGRect rect)
	{% endhighlight %}

	<p>
		I’ve often needed to log the frame I am working on and have either created this as a macro or just quickly typed out the string format. Never again! Not sure how much I’ll use the CGRectFromString function, I much prefer the C-style:
	</p>
	
	{% highlight objectivec %}
		CGRect rect = {oX, oY, sW, sH};
	{% endhighlight %}

	<p>	
		Next up, SPLIT SCREEN VIEW in Xcode. I work on a 30” monitor and sometime having so many open windows gets to be a mess. I’ve often seen the little button for a horizontal split view in the upper right of the editor window, but didn’t know how to do a vertical split.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-align:center;">
		<img src="/articles/images/2010-11-24/xcode_image.png">
	</p>

	<p>
		The icon even looks like a horizontal split (icon right below the lock in the image). Fortunately, holding OPTION (⌥) while clicking it will create a vertical split window.
