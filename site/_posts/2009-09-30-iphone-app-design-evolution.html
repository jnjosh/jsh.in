		My latest project has been for a <a href="http://www.tripleddesign.com">client</a> that was looking for a focused percentage calculator. A quick search through the App Store shows a lot of tip calculators and even some percentage calculators. It would be very easy to pop a few controls and some simple math together to make an app, but aren't Mac / iPhone interfaces supposed to be a bit more thought out? Well, yeah.

		Ok, I said the post would be about inspiration. You don't have to look far to see the inspiration for the design of 100percent. <a href="http://tapbots.com/">Tapbots</a> create wonderful apps that are <em>"utility robots designed and engineered for your iPhone and iPod Touch"</em>. Now, 100percent is not a robot and not a direct clone, but you have to give credit when its due.
