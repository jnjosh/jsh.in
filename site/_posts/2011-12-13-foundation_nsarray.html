title: Foundation Monday - NSArray
preview: In an effort to blog more, I'm creating a new series of posts all focused on Cocoa's base framework, Foundation. Each week I'll write about a class in the Foundation framework in alphabetical order. This week I'll be covering NSArray (and NSMutableArray), Foundation's easy to use array object for storing ordered data.
tags:
- Cocoa
- Foundation
- Development

				<a name="super_1" />1. Apparently, the Thursday that people started arriving at CocoaConf (for either the tutorial or the NSCoder Night) was the same day that DoubleTree decided to rebrand the Brownstone. I even drove pass the hotel that night..<a href="#ident_1">[↩]</a><br />
				<a name="super_2" />2. Originally it was two, but thankfully they allowed me to drop the AutoCAD for Mac plugin session..<a href="#ident_3">[↩]</a><br />
