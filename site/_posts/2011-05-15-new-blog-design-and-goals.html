title: New blog, new design, old goals and new goals.
preview: Why am I starting up my blog again? Haven't I done this before? Looking at my blogging history is quite embarrasing. Every year, I get the itch to start writing again, start up my blog, write for a few months then stop. A year later, rinse and repeat.

Every year, I get the itch to start writing again, start up my blog<sup><a href="#super" name="ident_1">1</a></sup>, write for a few months then stop. A year later, rinse and repeat. So, here I am again, but this time is somewhat different. Promise! <span style="font-size:12px; color:#999999;">(This is more a promise to my self than you.)</span></p>

			I can go on and on about reasons for this, but basically I just like writing. It is one of those things I know I suck at, and want to be better at. Writing here is a way to make me better. I've also been inspired by the writings of others in the Cocoa community. These people spend their days as indie devs and yet still find time to write about what interests them.

			You don't have to. This is more for me than you. This is why there are no comments. Part of what I want to do with my blog (which is also why I rewrote it using Jekyll) is that it is my playground. I can do fun things like this.
