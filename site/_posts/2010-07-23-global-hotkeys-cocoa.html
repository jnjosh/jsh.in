title: Global hotkeys in Cocoa on Snow Leopard
preview: I am working on a small app at the office for all our mac users to help locate files on the network (more on this later), I decided to go with a spotlight style NSStatusItem based app. I’ve been really inspired by these apps lately (when done right).  Mostly thanks to Notify.

		To make this more handy I decided to include a global hotkey. For Leopard and earlier, one problem is you have to use the old Carbon-based events. Most likely due to my Carbon-naivety, I had troubles with this.

		Luckily, I found this post and learned that Snow Leopard added addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:maskhandler: to NSEvent:
	</p>

	{% highlight objectivec %}
		+ (id)addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:(NSEventMask)mask handler:(void (^)(NSEvent*))block
	{% endhighlight %}﻿
