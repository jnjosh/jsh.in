	I've recently moved beyond using wordpress or tumbler for this blog and jumped into the world of baked (or static) sites. This post is a look at building this blog using the open source static site generator, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.

	I've been struggling with my blog for years. Always wanting to redesign it. Never happy with themes. Since reading a <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs">post by Brent Simmons</a>, I decided to bake this blog.<sup><a href="#super_1" name="ident_1">1</a></sup>

	<p class="grid_6 quotage">"... even in the year 2011, if your weblog gets Fireballed, there’s a good chance it won’t be able to handle it. That seems crazy. It’s not 1997 — it’s 2011."<br />-- <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs">Brent Simmons</a></p>

	<h3>Baked Blogs?</h3>
	<p>
	Since when did this become about cooking? It isn't. The idea is simple: Build your site in pure HTML/CSS/Javascript and let it live on the server as static files. "What? Is it the 90s again?", I hear you asking. Yeah, it is a bit old school, but it's not a crazy idea. Static files can be served from any server and it satisfies that geeky part of you that wants to <a href="https://github.com/jnjosh/jsh.in">keep your blog in source control</a>. So the real secret is how do you do this?

	<h3>What is the recipe?</h3>
	<p>
	By baking your blog, does it mean you have to write static websites for every single page? Of course not. There are many different ways to do this. As Brent Simmons points out in his <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs">plea for baked blogs</a>, there are two main ways to do this:

	<div class="container_12" id="super">
		<a name="super_1" />1. Yeah, I took my time in converting my blog. That post is from March. <a href="#ident_1">[↩]</a><br />
	</div>

<!-- template

	<div class="container_12" id="super">
