	<p class="grid_6 quotage">"... even in the year 2011, if your weblog gets Fireballed, there’s a good chance it won’t be able to handle it. That seems crazy. It’s not 1997 — it’s 2011."<br />-- <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs">Brent Simmons</a></p>
	<p class="grid_6 quotage">"Baked pages are easy to serve. You can almost always switch servers and software and they’ll still work."<br />-- <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000404">Aaron Swartz</a></p>

	Since when did this become about cooking? It isn't. The idea is simple: Build your site in pure HTML/CSS/Javascript and let it live on the server as static files. "What? Is it the 90s again?", I hear you asking. Yeah, it is a bit old school, but it's not a crazy idea. Static files can be served from any server and it satisfies that geeky part of you that wants to <a href="https://github.com/jnjosh/jsh.in">keep your blog in source control</a>.
