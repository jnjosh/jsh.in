		<p>
			Hi, I'm Josh Johnson. I'm a software developer, wannabe designer, filmmaker, and podcaster living in Raleigh, NC with my wife, my two teenagers (!), a comfort retriever named Ruby, and two cats. I've been developing software since I was 12 when my Dad gave me a Macintosh Plus with some form of BASIC.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since 2008 I've been focusing my personal time on learning and developing software for iPhone, iPad and the Mac. This has merged into my day job where I am now spending some time building mobile software for the company I work for. I'm also organizer of <a href="http://trianglecocoa.com">CocoaHeads RTP and NSCoder RTP</a>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			When not writing code or with my family, you can find me <a href="http://badmoviepodcast.com">podcasting about B-movies so bad that they are enjoyable</a> or dreaming up <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2522715/">movie ideas</a>.

		<p>
			This is a personal blog. Most of the time it will be about Cocoa-related topics,  but I usually have a lot of different interests that could find a way here. Lately, a <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/">lot of</a> <a href="http://inessential.com/">other</a> <a href="http://carpeaqua.com/">Mac</a> and iPhone Developers have taken their thoughts back to their blogs. Why not play along?
